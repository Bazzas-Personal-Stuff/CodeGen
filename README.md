# CodeGen

A very simple code generator with a similar syntax to JetBrains products' code templates.

## Embedding in a Package

1. Copy this repo to a folder called "CodeGen" inside your package folder: `Packages/com.bazzagibbs.examplepackage/CodeGen`
2. Find and replace the following within the CodeGen folder:
   - "MY_PACKAGE_NAMESPACE", e.g. `BazzaGibbs.ExamplePackage`
   - "MY_PACKAGE_URI", e.g. `com.bazzagibbs.examplepackage`
   - "MY_WIZARD_MENU_ITEM", the submenu under "Tools" where the wizard will be launched from. 
   e.g. `Example Package/Create Custom Example`
       - Note: if you want your wizard to be launched from somewhere other than the "Tools" tab, instead replace "Tools/MY_WIZARD_MENU_ITEM" with the full menu path.
   - "MY_WIZARD_WINDOW_TITLE", the name displayed when the wizard is opened
   - "MY_WIZARD_HELP_DIALOGUE", the text displayed as an information box at the top of the wizard. Include descriptions of what each macro should be replaced with, and any other instructions for the user.
3. In `CodeGenWizard.cs`, edit the "WizardHelp" string at the top to add a description of the macros in your templates.

## Writing Templates

```
###Game Variables/Editor/$TYPE.PASCAL$Drawer.cs
using UnityEditor;
namespace $NAMESPACE$ {
    [CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof($TYPE.PASCAL$))]
    class $TYPE.PASCAL$Drawer : PropertyDrawer {}
}
```

1. The first line of a template must begin with three # symbols, immediately followed by a local file path.
This line specifies the destination file path relative to the root output directory.
2. The rest of the file is valid C# code, except for macros which will be replaced.

### Macros

- Valid macros have the form `$MACRO_NAME.MODIFIER$`, where the modifier is optional.
- Modifiers perform some processing on the replacement string. For example, with a macro `$TYPE$` defined as the word "float"
  - `$TYPE$` is replaced with `float`
  - `$TYPE.PASCAL$` is replaced with `Float`
- Valid modifiers include:
    - `UPPER`: MYCLASS
    - `LOWER`: myclass
    - `PASCAL`: MyClass
    - `CAMEL`: myClass
    - `NAME`: same as `PASCAL`, but strips any non-alphanumeric. e.g. `MyClass<float>` -> `MyClassfloat`
- note: Pascal and Camel are currently limited to modifying the first character of a string.

## Unity Editor Wizard

### Buttons

- The "Get Macros" button will scan all the provided template files for valid macros and populate the "Macros" list with
empty entries.
- The "Generate" button will create an output file from each template and place it in the directory specified. If a file with the same name
already exists in the target directory it will be overwritten.

### Parameters

- **Template directory** (private) - Where the code generator will search for template files.
- **Output directory** - The root destination folder for any generated code files. Templates may create directories inside this folder.
- **Macro definitions** - What each \$MACRO\$ in the template files should be replaced with. The $ signs should be omitted here.
